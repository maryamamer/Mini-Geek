    <h1>The Ant And The Grasshopper</h1>
    <p>One bright day in late autumn a family of Ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine, drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer, when a starving Grasshopper, his fiddle under his arm, came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat.</p>
    <p>"What!" cried the Ants in surprise, "haven't you stored anything away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all last summer?"</p>
    <p>"I didn't have time to store up any food," whined the Grasshopper; "I was so busy making music that before I knew it the summer was gone."</p>
    <p>The Ants shrugged their shoulders in disgust."Making music, were you?" they cried. "Very well; now dance!" And they turned their backs on the Grasshopper and went on with their work.</p>
    <p>There's a time for work and a time for play.</p>
